# Tiny ML Occupancy Detection

The aim of this study is explain the different types of quantization methods of TensorFlow Lite and make a comparison 
with Neuton.AI platform. I would like to thank [Neuton.AI](https://neuton.ai/) for their help during the project. 

**The source of data is here:** [occupancy_detection_dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+#)

**The problem is:** Recognize whether someone is in the room or not based on measurements of temperature, humidity, 
light, and CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute.

**Features and Target**
- Temperature Humidity
- Light
- CO2
- Humidity Ratio
- Occupancy â€“ 0 - not occupied; 1 - occupied status.

There are two colab notebooks:

- [Occupancy_TFLite_Models.ipynb](Occupancy_TFLite_Models.ipynb): includes all types of quantization methods of 
  TensorFlow Lite.
- [Occupancy_TFLite_vs_NeutonAI.ipynb](Occupancy_TFLite_vs_NeutonAI.ipynb): includes the comparison with Neuton.AI
